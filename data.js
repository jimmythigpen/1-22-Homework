Every screen displays a little bit different. A back-lite computer screen and a printed image are two different animals. I use high quality matte photo paper for the best reproduction possible.  I think you will be pleased with what you receive.\r\n\r\n=== Search By Topic ===\r\nPlease use my shops search box below to find what you are looking for. \r\nI do custom requests.

    "description": "SOUTH CAROLINA Map, Map of South Carolina, South Carolina, Charleston, The  Citadel, Fine Art Print, Custom Maps\r\n\r\n-All of our Flag maps are custom created by me with watercolor paints and other elements which are photographed and scanned into digital files.  I use a Wacom tablet (digital paintbrush) to digitally hand paint and creatively combine each map.  The end result is an amazing work of art!  \r\n\r\n                                            -Watermarks are not on your finished prints!!\r\n\r\n-The white border is &quot;built into&quot; each print.  This saves you money when framing since you will not need to purchase a mat.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n-Our prints are printed by a Professional Printing Company... They are NOT printed on a home printer.  The quality of our prints are the finest available; they are Archival Quality Images. \r\n              \r\n -DETAILS OF OUR PRINTING PROCESS:\r\n             ** 99-year acid-free Epson archival papers\r\n             ** High color gamut produces vivid colors by using a 12 ink printing system\r\n             ** Epson UltraChrome HDR pigment-based inks (museum quality prints)\r\n             ** 10mil (260 g\/m2) paper thickness (heavy weight photo papers)\r\n             ** Printed at 2880x1440dpi (ultra resolutions)\r\n\r\n\r\n-Available sizes (inches): 11x14, 16x20, 18x24, 24x36, 30x40, 40x60\r\n\r\n-Framing not included.\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n-We are located in Greenville, SC, but our prints ship from Rhode Island, USA.  We try to process our orders in 12-24 hours and often on the same day they are placed.  Printing to arrival at your mailbox is usually within 7 days... It is a bit longer for international orders of course.\r\n\r\n-If your print arrives damaged, we will replace it no charge.  If you are not satisfied with your print, you can get a full refund (minus the shipping charges to send it back to us) within 7 days. Our goal is to give you a quality product that you are proud to display in your home or office.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           **** We Do Custom Maps....Just email us with your Specific Needs. ****\r\n\r\n**IF YOU DO NOT SEE YOUR STATE OR COUNTRY, WE WILL BE GLAD TO MAKE IT AT NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Please note that actual colors may vary slightly due to monitor settings.",

    "description": "SOUTH CAROLINA Map, Map of South Carolina, South Carolina, CHARLESTON, Hilton Head, Myrtle Beach, Clemson, Gamecocks, Citadel, State Maps\r\n\r\n-All of our STATE MAPS are custom created by me with watercolor paints and other elements which are photographed and scanned into digital files.  I use a Wacom tablet (digital paintbrush) to digitally hand paint and creatively combine each map.  The end result is an amazing work of art!  \r\n\r\n                                            -Watermarks are not on your finished prints!!\r\n\r\n-The white border is &quot;built into&quot; each print.  This saves you money when framing since you will not need to purchase a mat.  Just email us if you would like the print with no border, and it can be done at no extra charge.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n-Our prints are printed by a Professional Printing Company... They are NOT printed on a home printer.  The quality of our prints are the finest available; they are Archival Quality Images. \r\n              \r\n -DETAILS OF OUR PRINTING PROCESS:\r\n             ** 99-year acid-free Epson archival papers\r\n             ** High color gamut produces vivid colors by using a 12 ink printing system\r\n             ** Epson UltraChrome HDR pigment-based inks (museum quality prints)\r\n             ** 10mil (260 g\/m2) paper thickness (heavy weight photo papers)\r\n             ** Printed at 2880x1440dpi (ultra resolutions)\r\n\r\n\r\n-Available sizes (inches): 11x14, 16x20, 18x24, 24x36, 30x40, 40x60\r\n\r\n-Framing not included.\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n-We are located in Greenville, SC, but our prints ship from Rhode Island, USA.  We try to process our orders in 12-24 hours and often on the same day they are placed.  Printing to arrival at your mailbox is usually within 7 days... It is a bit longer for international orders of course.\r\n\r\n-If your print arrives damaged, we will replace it no charge.  If you are not satisfied with your print, you can get a full refund (minus the shipping charges to send it back to us) within 7 days. Our goal is to give you a quality product that you are proud to display in your home or office.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           **** We Do Custom Maps....Just email us with your Specific Needs. ****\r\n\r\n**IF YOU DO NOT SEE YOUR STATE, WE WILL BE GLAD TO MAKE IT AT NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Please note that actual colors may vary slightly due to monitor settings.",
